# Split Django Models

Split the models file generated by Django *inspectdb* into several files with proper names, classes and imports.

## Usage

Generate your models:  
```bash
python3 manage.py inspectdb > models.py
```

Run the script:  
```bash
./split_django_models.sh models.py
```

Put them all into a folder so you can enjoy the step bellow:  

The script also creates a *__init__.py* file, so you can import them all at once:  
```python
from yourapp.models import *
```

Done!
